# Regions

## St. John's Metro

### Commuting
See [Bike St. John's maps](http://www.bikestjohns.ca/maps/) and [2009 Cycling Master Plan](https://www.stjohns.ca/sites/default/files/files/publication/Cycling%20Master%20plan%5B1%5D_0.pdf) for current infrastructure and [City of St. John's Bike Master Plan](https://www.engagestjohns.ca/6586/documents/16412) for planned expansion.

When route planning, [Strava Heatmaps](https://www.strava.com/heatmap#13.59/-52.73183/47.57971/hot/ride) can be a useful resource to highlight commonly used routes.

### Recreational/Family

### Road
Road biking can be a challenge in St. John's proper but fortunately you don't have to go far to find quiet town roads and scenic vistas. It is possible to ride out of the city but some may prefer to drive to a start location slightly outside of the city.

Popular Routes:
- [Logy Bay/Outer Cove/Middle Cove (25km, 350m)](https://www.strava.com/activities/2410225415): A short ride easily accessible from the east end with quiet roads and nice views. Can be extended to Torbay/Bauline/Portugal Cove/etc.
- [St. John's/Cape Spear/Petty Harbour (52km, 817m)](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/11613065): A scenic and hilly ride with a break stop in the quaint town of Petty Harbour (don't miss [Watershed Coffee](https://www.facebook.com/watershedcoffeeshop/)).

### Mountain
Expect rocks, roots, hills, and spectacular views. With few exceptions the trails around St. John's are not well marked, so bring some sort of navigation with you, such as a smartphone with Trailforks app.

There is an extensive trail network in [Pippy Park](https://www.trailforks.com/region/pippy-park/) with a variety of terrain and plenty of beginner-friendly trails.

[White Hills](https://www.trailforks.com/region/white-hills/) is a classic mountain bike area in the east end of St. John's with a dedicated crew of trailbuilders. The trails here are technical intermediate to advanced level trails, some featuring berms, jumps, drops, and other features. Trail reports and trail building info is posted in [FRMS Trail Building and Riding](https://www.facebook.com/groups/833332940068319/) Facebook group. Full-suspension mountain bike is recommended but not required.

[Richmond Hill](https://www.trailforks.com/region/richmond-hill-13822/) has some fun technical trails in the Southside Hills above Kilbride. Trail building info is posted in [Richmond Hill-Southside Mountain Bike Trails](https://www.facebook.com/groups/487348724623180/). Park at the end of Densmore's Lane cul-de-sac.

### Fatbiking
"Fat bikes" (bikes with ~3.8+ inch tires) are perfect for the rough and rocky terrain of Newfoundland. Winter fatbiking (snow biking) provides a beginner-friendly escape to the long winters of St. John's where you can get out in the woods with some friends and escape the wind and slush, and maybe even have a little boilup. A dedicated community of riders and groomers helps to keep the snow packed down and fun to ride. The trails can develop ice patches due to the freeze-thaw cycles in St. John's so studded tires are recommended. As with mountain biking, some sort of navigation, such as smartphone with Trailforks app, is recommended as many of the trails do not include signage.

The fatbiking season culminates in the [Pippy Snowbike Festival](https://www.facebook.com/pippysnowbike/) which includes a large group ride around Pippy Park, fatbike demos, and an afterparty.

There is an extensive trail network in [Pippy Park](https://www.trailforks.com/region/pippy-park/) with trails groomed by volunteers for snowbiking throughout the winter. The trails are well marked and suitable for most skill levels. Grooming reports, ride reports, and group rides are posted regularly in the [Avalon Fatbikers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/217745801944217/)
 Facebook group.

[Richmond Hill](https://www.trailforks.com/region/richmond-hill-13822/) is also a great area for winter fatbiking with dedicated maintainers and some fun, fast trails. Grooming and ride reports are posted in the [Richmond Hill-Southside Mountain Bike Trails](https://www.facebook.com/groups/487348724623180/)

Newfoundland is a perfect place for adventures on a fatbike. The [T'Railway](https://www.trailway.ca/) runs 880km across the entire island from Port Aux Basques to St. John's and there are multiple branch routes throughout the island. See the excellent ride reports from [slow:biker](https://theslowbiker.wordpress.com/) and [bikepacking.com](https://bikepacking.com/routes/newfoundland-trailway/).
