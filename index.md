### Fatbiking
The long winters in St. John's are ideal for fatbiking where you can get out in the woods with some friends and escape the wind and slush and maybe even have a little boilup.

There is an extensive trail network in [Pippy Park](https://www.trailforks.com/region/pippy-park/) with trails groomed by volunteers for snowbiking throughout the winter. The trails are well marked and suitable for most skill levels. Grooming reports, ride reports, and group rides are posted regularly in the [Avalon Fatbikers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/217745801944217/)
